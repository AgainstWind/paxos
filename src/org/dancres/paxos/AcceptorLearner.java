/**
 * Implements the Acceptor/Learner state machine.  Note that the instance running in the same JVM as the current leader
 * is to all intents and purposes (bar very strange hardware or operating system failures) guaranteed to receive packets
 * from the leader.  Thus if a leader declares SUCCESS then the local instance will receive those packets.  This can be
 * useful for processing client requests correctly and signalling interested parties as necessary.
 *
 * @todo Success messages must contain the round number so we can validate they follow on from the current BEGIN.
 * If it doesn't follow on we must OLD_ROUND. In the original algorithmic description from "Paxos Made Simple" accepts
 * are broadcast to all learners so they can see a quorum for a particular round. As we use a distinguished learner,
 * in the form of the Leader, it must broadcast the quorum itself which means it must include the round number in case
 * some other leader gains acceptance and now wants to send out a value. We could fix this by sending the value out
 * during the accept phase and then have the success message be merely a commit of that value. Then a round number
 * is not required for success as any leader that gets as far as success must have accounted for the values sent in
 * accept when processing last messages. Success would just then contain the sequence number and any AL that hasn't
 * seen the associated begin would take no action (no sync of value to disk and no ack of the success), such an AL
 * would then perform recovery as the result of not incrementing it's low watermark (in response to success) and 
 * detecting a missed round at the next begin/accept.
 * 
 * @todo Checkpoint must include low watermark etc.

     * Introducing recovery:
     * 
     * Low watermark is -1
     * When packet arrives, unless it's for seqnum 0 (which indicates this is the initial paxos execution) we'll store
     * it in packet buffer and trigger recovery (which should set a flag which causes further recovery triggers to
     * be skipped but stores packets up meantime).
     * 
     * Recovery looks at current low watermark, sees it's -1 and opens log, restoring checkpointed state and then
     * playing through any outstanding packets in the log. On completion, it dispatches a RESTORED packet
     * into AcceptorLearner.
     * 
     * AcceptorLearner sees RESTORED packet and proceeds to try and replay any packets out of the packet buffer, if it
     * can't it triggers another recovery. (The packets replayed will be those "since" the last packet recovered from
     * the log of the other node).
     *  
     * Recovery looks at current low watermark, sees it's not -1 and determines the log_id of the last log record 
     * committed by this AL. It then requests the log from another node from this log_id onwards and plays those
     * packets through the AL to catch it up. If it succeeds, it dispatches a RESTORED packet
     * to AcceptorLearner and behaviour is as above. 
     * 
     * If it fails (because the log_id is no longer in the valid range of the target's log, it closes the log 
     * (which will have been opened in the initial recovery case at least), delete's the files and attempts to grab
     * checkpoint and log from a node which has state up to and including at least low watermark seq num + 1.
     * 
     * Impl Ideas:
     * 
     * Perhaps when AL starts up (and when it triggers further recoveries beyond initial startup recovery) it has
     * an instance of a recoverer stored in a member. As the member is non-null, it sends all received packets to it
     * which can then be restored by it when it's completed its other recovery tasks. Also, because the member is
     * non-null it doesn't attempt further recoveries. The fact the field is set also indicates to the Leader what's
     * going on. To make this work means separating the public entry point for packet reception from the inner
     * processing layer. The public entry point does a check for the recoverer and then submits it to the inner
     * layer. The inner layer is directly accessed by the recovery routines so they can drive through packets to effect
     * state transitions.
     * 
     * Maybe the log doesn't consist of packets, just state transitions which could be re-applied to AL state. Packets
     * are only stored temporarily during recovery and when asked for a LAST we consult the log via a replay for the
     * relevant SUCCESS transition. When packets are fed through, if they are out of date according to the low watermark
     * we simply ignore them. The advantage of state transition is we don't need to re-parse the packet, skipping
     * around recovery and such. 
     * 
     * The low watermark should consist of two elements, the sequence number and the associated log_id. We'd use the
     * sequence number to rule out old packets and the log number to help us during recovery when we need to ask for
     * logs from another node.
     * 
     * We don't need the high watermark as we don't store a value during a BEGIN only during a SUCCESS. This means
     * we can compute the range to recover purely from all the low watermarks (which are updated every time we see
     * a contiguous SUCCESS). If the low watermark is lower than any leader's seen so far, it's the minimum. If it's
     * greater than any we've seen before, it's the maximum.
     * 
     * @todo:
 	 * A leader when consulting it's AL may then issue a collect for something that is way out of date
     * and thus would need to recover itself. How do we signal that back via a LAST and how does it do recovery?
