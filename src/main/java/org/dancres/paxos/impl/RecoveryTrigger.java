/**
 * We track each completed proposal expecting them to be in approximately linear order.
 * Gaps can appear because we miss some packets in which case we ultimately need to close them.
 * If we're slightly out of order then that proposal will be settled shortly and we can continue
 * processing however, if the gap remains and the proposal sequence number moves too far from the gap
 * it is likely we need to recover. In essence the maximum number of concurrent requests forms the
 * approx maximum distance from the low watermark that can be tolerated with gaps.
 *
 * Gap is measured between low watermark and the lowest above that mark completed recently.
