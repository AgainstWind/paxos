/**
 * Each paxos instance is driven and represented by an individual instance of <code>Leader</code>.
 * These are created, tracked and driven by this factory class. The factory also looks after handling error outcomes
 * that require an adjustment in round or sequence number and heartbeating.
 *
 * Leader selection is a client-based element (or at least outside of the library). It is up to the client to decide
 * which leader to go to and it may be re-directed should that leader be aware of another leader. A failing leader
 * provides no guidance in respect of other leadership.
 *
 * Paxos needs only to be used to make changes to state. Read operations need not be passed through Paxos but they
 * do need to be dispatched to a node that is up-to-date. The node that is pretty much guaranteed to be up to date
 * is the existing leader. Other nodes could be used to support read operations so long as a level of staleness is
 * acceptable. If the state is timestamped in some fashion, once can use those timestamps to ensure that updates
 * based on the state are applied to the latest version (by checking its timestamp) or rejected.
 *
 * Rough API:
 *
 * newLeader() can be hidden behind Core.submit or similar and should throw an OutOfDateException whilst the local AL
 * is out of date and until it declares itself up to date. This is necessary because client's cannot see responses
 * because the AL will not produce events until it's back up to date. Note: We may want Common.signal to account for
 * this to.
 *
 * A server using this library needs to handle out of date. It also needs to handle other leader.
 * In all cases it typically passes a message to it's client to request a switch of leader. It can use the meta data
 * per Paxos node to hold the server contact details (ip, port etc). In response to other leader it would pull the
 * relevant meta data and re-direct the client. In the case of out of date, it would use some "well known" policy to
 * determine an alternate leader, pull the meta data and re-direct the client. Note it may need to send "no leader" to
 * a client if it cannot identify a candidate. All other types of error result in dispatching a fail to the client for
 * the request it submitted. Should a request succeed, it is server dependent what action is taken. It could be to
 * execute a command or change a value etc.
 *
 * In the case of out of date the server should also use contact details
 * for some other node to obtain a checkpoint with which it will update the AL. Up to date might, in tandem with out
 * of date allow the library to avoid calling newLeader and handle an exception. Note that the installation of a
 * new checkpoint can immediately generate an up to date followed shortly after by an out of date which will trigger
 * another attempt to recover in the server. This ensures the server's recovery approach can be relatively simple.
 * We may want to allow comparison and serialization of checkpoint handles so they can be used in the process of
 * obtaining a checkpoint to ensure what's being downloaded and installed is more up to date than what we have
 * locally.
