/**
 * Implements the leader state machine.
 *
 * @todo State recovery - basic model will be to resolve memory state from the last checkpoint and then replay the log
 * to bring that memory state up-to-date (possibly by re-announcing completions via the AcceptorLearner).  Once that
 * is done, we could become the leader.
 * @todo If some other leader failed, we need to resolve any previous slots outstanding. It's possible the old leader
 * secured a slot and declared a value but didn't report back to the client. In that case, the client would see it's
 * leader fail to respond and have to either submit an operation to determine whether it's previous attempt succeeded
 * or submit an idempotent operation that could be retried safely multiple times. Other cases include the leader
 * reserving a slot but not filling in a value in which case we need to fill it with a null value (which AcceptorLearner
 * would need to drop silently rather than deliver it to a listener). It's also possible the leader proposed a value
 * but didn't reach a majority due to network issues and then died. In such a case, the new leader will have to settle
 * that round with the partially agreed value.  It's likely that will be done with the originating client absent so
 * as per the leader failed to report case, the client will need to retry with the appropriate protocol.
 * @todo Add a test for validating multiple sequence number recovery.
