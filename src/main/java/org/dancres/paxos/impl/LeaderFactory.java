     * We currently infer multi-paxos by lining up AL seq num with our own. We should
     * ideally infer it from the direct result of the previous leader. Similarly for
     * sequence number to use, round number etc.
     *
     * Currently we try and make this work by not constructing a leader until the
     * previous leader has finished one way or another. A better design would be
     * to pass into the next leader it's previous leader and treat that as a state
     * input for the next leader. The leader state machine would wait on that
     * state input stabilising and, when it happens, proceed accordingly
     * (setup for multi-paxos, choose a sequence number etc).
     *
     * Open challenge to solve with this approach is what to do when there is no
     * previous leader. We'd need to construct an initial fake leader that can
     * trigger no multi-paxos, a sequence number from the AL etc.
     *
     * Another challenge is how to signal/trigger the chained leader to proceed.
     * It might be done by delivering a new message of the form (PRIOR_STATE) into
     * the next leader's core message processing loop.
     *
     * Another challenge is heartbeating with this construct. Perhaps we chain
     * a fake leader to receive the PRIOR_STATE and add the next leader to that
     * creating a chain of real->fake->real->fake->real->fake. If a fake detects
     * it is last in the queue it holds the state and uses it to determine if
     * heartbeats should run. When the next real leader is chained onto it,
     * heartbeats would be stopped and the held state is passed over to the next
     * real leader.
