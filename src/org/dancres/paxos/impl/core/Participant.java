     * We must wait a settle time before clearing out.  We should be able to junk it when we see rounds for the next
     * entry (or one several entry's further on - possibly current seqnum plus total number of possible leaders + 1).
     *
     * @todo if we receive a BEGIN or COLLECT that invalidates our old round it would make sense to see if the nodeId is
     * superior to ours.  If that is the case, another leader is active and we should abort our leader for the proposal
     * if we have one running.  An alternative is to send in the OLDROUND message the node id so the proposer can
     * decide for itself to cease chatter and inform it's client of a new leader.
